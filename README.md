Recreaction of a slider from Boba Ice Cream's website.

The slider uses Swiper JS for functionality and GSAP to handle the animations.

When the slide changes, an event is fired that triggers the GSAP animations for the slide headings, Images and Baackground.

The background colour is handles by a function that sets the BG colour based on the class of the active slide ( simple eg is does .active-slide contain .is-strawberry? then bgColor = #fff)
